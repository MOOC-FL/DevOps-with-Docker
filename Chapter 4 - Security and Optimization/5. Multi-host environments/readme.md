#### Multi-host environments
- Now that we have mastered containers in small systems with Docker Compose it's time to look beyond what the tools we practiced are capable of. In situations where we have more than a single host machine we cannot rely solely on Docker. However, Docker does contain other tools to help us with automatic deployment, scaling and management of dockerized applications.

- In the scope of this course, we cannot go into how to use the tools introduced in this section, but leaving them without a mention would be a disservice.
