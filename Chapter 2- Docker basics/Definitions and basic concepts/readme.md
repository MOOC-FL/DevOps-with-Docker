#### Running containers​
- `docker conatiner run hello-world`
- `docker container run` has shorthand for `docker run`
```bash
$ docker container run hello-world
```
```bash
$ docker run hello-world
```
#### Docker CLI basics​
- We are using the command line to interact with the "Docker Engine" that is made up of 3 parts:
1. command line interface (CLI) client
2. a REST API
3. Docker daemon
- When you run a command, e.g. `docker container run`, behind the scenes the CLI client sends a request to the **Docker daemon** through the **REST API**. The Docker daemon takes care of images, containers and other resources.
> You can read the docs for more information(opens in a new tab)(opens in a new tab). But even though you will find over 50 commands in the documentation, only a handful of them are needed for general use. There's a list of the most commonly used basic commands at the end of this section.
- One of them is already familiar: `docker container run <image>`, which instructs daemon to create a container from the image and downloading the image if it is not available.

- Let's remove the image since we will not need it anymore, `docker image rm hello-world` sounds about right. However, this should fail with the following error:
```bash
$ docker image rm hello-world
  Error response from daemon: conflict: unable to remove repository reference "hello-world" (must force) - container <container ID> is using its referenced image <image ID>
```
- This means that a container that was created from the image hello-world still exists and that removing hello-world could have consequences. So before removing images, you should have the referencing container removed first. Forcing is usually a bad idea, especially as we are still learning.

> Run `docker container ls -a` to list all containers again.
```bash
$ docker container ls -a
  CONTAINER ID   IMAGE           COMMAND        CREATED          STATUS                      PORTS     NAMES
  b7a53260b513   hello-world     "/hello"       35 minutes ago   Exited (0) 35 minutes ago             brave_bhabha
  1cd4cb01482d   hello-world     "/hello"       41 minutes ago   Exited (0) 41 minutes ago             vibrant_bell
```
- Notice that containers have a CONTAINER ID and NAME. The names are currently autogenerated. When we have a lot of different containers, we can use grep (or another similar utility) to filter the list:

```bsh
$ docker container ls -a | grep hello-world
```
- Let's remove the container with `docker container rm` command. It accepts a container's `name` or `ID` as its arguments.

- Notice that the command also works with the first few characters of an `ID.` For example, if a container's ID is `3d4bab29dd67`, you can use `docker container rm 3d `to delete it. Using the shorthand for the ID will not delete multiple containers, so if you have two IDs starting with 3d, a warning will be printed, and neither will be deleted. You can also use multiple arguments: docker container rm id1 id2 id3

- If you have hundreds of stopped containers and you wish to delete them all, you should use `docker container prune`. **Prune** can also be used to remove "dangling" images with `docker image prune`. Dangling images are images that don't have a name and are not used. They can be created manually and are automatically generated during build. Removing them just saves some space.

- And finally you can use `docker system prune` to clear almost everything. We aren't yet familiar with the exceptions that `docker system prune` doesn't remove.

- After removing all of the hello-world containers, `run d`ocker image rm hello-world` to delete the image. You can use `docker image ls` to confirm that the image is not listed.

- You can also use the `image pull` command to download images without running them: so docker `image pull hello-world` would bring the image back to our computer.
